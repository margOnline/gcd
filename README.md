This application is written in PHP 5.3.

<h4>Objective</h4>

Complete a short coding exercise for a London based tech company to demonstrate approach to problem solving for a clean build project.

Any programming language and technology can be used to complete the test. It is recommended that the time spent on this exercise be limited to 20 minutes.

<h4>Requirements</h4>

Write a function called GCD that prints the greatest common divisor of two positive integers (a and b). 

<h4>Approach</h4>

Build a simple HTML web based form that takes 2 numbers as input and displays the greatest common denominator beneath the form. The form posts to a php file which includes a file that defines the gcd function. 

The gcd function uses recursion to implement the common form of Euclid's algorithm.

<h4>Technical Configuration</h4>

Languages: PHP, HTML, CSS
